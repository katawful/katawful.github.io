## Robins doing their **thing**
Robins are super silly and they're very plentiful around me!
They're super active birds and a lot of them are quite the adventurous and daring, allowing me to get close up pictures relatively easy.
Plus the way they search for food makes them wonderful models.
They tend to stand still for a bit every once in a while.
