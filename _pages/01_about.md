Hi, I'm Kat (not KatKat the Russian modder).

I'm a random tech nerd who loves stupid things and hates modding Oblivion.
I try to post somewhat often about Linux and Oblivion and probably whatever else suits my fancy.

You can find me on GitHub as the username [katawful](https://github.com/katawful).

I'm also on the Nexus as the username [KatsAwful](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/66104901).

If neither suit you, email me at katisntgood@gmail.com
