I've finally gotten around to updating my site!
There's a ton of new changes so lets go through them all!

## Table of Contents
Table of contents are now supported on this site.
You can easily browse through a page.

The table of contents will slide down the right side of the page as you scroll too, so you never get lost.
This is a massive help to guides, but won't be available on every post.
This also allows permalinks to specific sections of a post.

## Category Browsing
You can now browse through categories!

|:---:|:---:|
|I've added options to browse posts by categories|You can also go to a category from the blog page|




This is a touch limited, only one category is allow per post.
Tag support will come later.

## Phone Support
Previous phone support was frankly awful, I hacked in a lot of sizing out of sheer laziness and frustration:

|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|  While you could read a blog post easily on my site on your phone  |               Browsing on a phone was terrible and ugly                |

I didn't want to deal with fixing it.
Now, however, it looks fantastic!

|:----------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------:|
|       Now you can easily browse through everything!        |               And reading remains just as good!                |

## Social Sharing
You can now easily share posts by using one of the buttons on the bottom of the page!

This should make things a bit easier for everyone

## The Future
While I'm super pleased with the changes I've been able to do so far, there's still more I'd like to have.
A comment provider would be super nice to have.
I would also like to add a way to show off my art in a better manner.
Flopping pictures into a blog post isn't that.
Tag support is another big thing I'd like to add, or at least fixing my dumb categories system.
That's a touch weird in implementation so I really ought to change it lol.
