# Background
Back in 2020 I had built this site using Jeykll. I didn't really know what I was doing, throwing whatever I could find at the problem till it stuck. Eventually it became so bloated and unmanageable that I just couldn't really work on it anymore. So over the past couple months I have been rebuild it from scratch, not using any Jekyll plugins if I could handle it. It is in a much more manageable state with only the features I want.

# What's here?
Most basic features are here, like heading linkage, latest posts, sidebar, and more. Not everything is here still, and over the course of the next month or so I will be adding those features back. They require more work than just a simple blog, but is a tertiary feature so not one I'm super in the rush to implement. For now all of the features I need are here.
