## The Beginnings

5sf is a channel of its time.
An incredibly inventive and well produced channel (particularly in the later years), I feel that a lot of people either overlooked the channel or don't even know about it.
Especially with the love of Vines and now TikTok, I'm surprised it hasn't seen a resurgence of nostalgia within the past few years.
I still adore going through the channel and finding 5sf that I love and ones' I don't remember well.
Hell, I might even find one's that I like.
And the idea popped into my head, what if I were to review every single 5sf in existence?
And so here we are.

## Reviewing

I think I want to be very specific with how I'm going to tackle this.
There's not only just the video itself, but also the descriptions.
There's also the problem of 5sf being 13 years old by now, so yikes content is bound to happen.
So I think in order to be as thorough and as fair as possible, I need to include all of these aspects.

### Rating

I'm not a big fan of number rating.
They're completely arbitrary and are skewed in the mind of the viewer.
A 7/10 game is seen as "middle of the road", 9/10 is a "great game", and 10/10 is seen as "absolutely perfect".
I want to avoid that, so instead I'm going to take a different aspect.

As I mentioned earlier, yikes content is aplenty throughout the history of the channel.
But it's not just "yikes" or "no yikes", there's a bit of nuance in how yikes 5sf can be sometimes.
There's also the fact that not all videos are great.

That's why I am going to define my scale.
Yes it's rather arbitrary, but it at least should give a better outlook on what I think about each 5sf.

### The Scale

| Scale Name                       | Meaning                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Yikes                            | Complete yikes, kinda just offensive without being funny at all.                                                              |
| One Yike                         | Still kind of offensive, but is a lot more earnest about it. Or it could be unintentional, but still lead to a funny outcome. |
| Half Yike                        | Upholds something offensive, but doesn't seem to be mean spirited at all.                                                  |
| It's a Video                     | Completely unfunny, but not offensive at all.                                                                                 |
| Quickly Breathed Through My Nose | Slightly funny, but that kind of funny that's "I understand that thus its funny.                                              |
| Knee Slapper                     | Good short laugh, really slaps your knees.                                                                                    |
| Perfection                       | You remember this for years to come. There isn't a funnier or better video in your mind.                                      |

It's not a perfect scale, but it gets across the ideas I want to present.
For the video descriptions I'll be using a similar system but it won't be as involved.
Mostly just what I'm feeling for it at the moment.

## The Reviews

I'll be starting the reviews soonish, wait for that for the future.
